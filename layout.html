                A design is a plan or specification for the construction of an object or system or for the implementation of an activity or process or the result of that plan or specification in the form of a <a href="#">prototype</a>, product, or <a href="#">process</a>. 
                <br><br>
                The verb to design expresses the process of developing a design. In some cases, the direct construction of an object without an explicit prior plan (such as in craftwork, some engineering, coding, and graphic design) may also be considered to be a design activity. The design usually has to satisfy certain <a href="#">goals</a> and constraints; may take into account aesthetic, functional, economic, or socio-political considerations; and is expected to interact with a certain <a href="#">environment</a>. 
                <br><br>
                Typical examples of designs include <a href="#">architectural</a> and <a href="#">engineering</a> drawings, <a href="#">circuit diagrams</a>, <a href="#">sewing patterns</a> and less tangible artefacts such as <a href="#">business process</a> models.<sup><a href="#">[1]</a></sup>

                People who produce designs are called <a href="#">designers</a>. The term 'designer' generally refers to someone who works professionally in one of the various design areas. Within the professions, the word 'designer' is generally qualified by the area of practice (so one may be, for example, a <a href="#">fashion designer</a>, a <a href="#">product designer</a>, a <a href="#">web designer</a>, or an <a href="#">interior designer</a>), but it can also designate others such as architects and engineers (see below: Types of designing). 
                <br><br>
                A designer's sequence of activities to produce a design is called a design process, using <a href="#">design thinking</a> and possibly <a href="#">design methods</a>. The process of creating a design can be brief (a quick sketch) or lengthy and complicated, involving considerable research, negotiation, reflection, <a href="#">modeling</a>, interactive adjustment, and re-design.
                <br><br>
                Designing is also a widespread activity outside of the professions, done by more people than just those formally recognized as designers. In his influential book The Sciences of the Artificial the interdisciplinary scientist <a href="#">Herbert A. Simon</a> proposed that "Everyone designs who devises courses of action aimed at changing existing situations into preferred ones".<sup><a href="#">[2]</a></sup> And according to the design researcher <a href="#">Nigel Cross</a> "Everyone can â€“ and does â€“ design", and "Design ability is something that everyone has, to some extent, because it is embedded in our brains as a natural cognitive function".<sup><a href="#">[3]</a></sup>

                        The rational model has been widely criticized on two primary grounds.  First, designers do not work this way â€“ extensive empirical evidence has demonstrated that designers do not act as the rational model suggests.<sup><a href="#">[12]</a></sup><sup><a href="#">[13]</a></sup><sup><a href="#">[25]</a></sup>
                        <br><br>
                        Second, there are unrealistic assumptions â€“ goals are often unknown when a design project begins, and the requirements and constraints continue to change.<sup><a href="#">[11]</a></sup><sup><a href="#">[26]</a></sup>
